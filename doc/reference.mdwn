Communicators
-------------

  : Predefined communicator that contains all processes.

`comm:rank()`

  : Returns the rank of the process.

`comm:size()`

  : Returns the number of processes.


Point-to-point communication
----------------------------

`mpi.send(buf, count, datatype, dest, tag, comm)`

  : Performs a blocking send. A block of `count` elements with datatype
    `datatype` is read from `buf` and sent to the process with rank `dest`;
    unless `dest` is **nil**, in which case no send is performed. `tag` is
    a non-negative integer that identifies the message.

`mpi.recv(buf, count, datatype, source, tag, comm)`

  : Performs a blocking receive. A block of `count` elements with datatype
    `datatype` is received from the process with rank `source` and stored
    in `buf`; unless `source` is **nil**, in which case no receive is
    performed. `tag` is a non-negative integer that identifies the message.

`mpi.sendrecv(sendbuf, sendcount, sendtype, dest, sendtag, recvbuf, recvcount, recvtype, source, recvtag, comm)`

  : Performs a blocking send and receive. A block of `sendcount` elements
    with datatype `sendtype` is read from `sendbuf` and sent to the process
    with rank `dest`; unless `dest` is **nil**, in which case no send is
    performed. `sendtag` is a non-negative integer that identifies the
    sent message. A block of `recvcount` elements with datatype `recvtype`
    is received from the process with rank `source` and stored in `recvbuf`;
    unless `source` is **nil**, in which case no receive is performed.
    `recvtag` is a non-negative integer that identifies the received message.

`mpi.sendrecv_replace(buf, count, datatype, dest, sendtag, source, recvtag, comm)`

  : Performs a blocking in-place send and receive. A block of `count`
    elements with datatype `datatype` is read from `buf` and sent to the
    process with rank `dest`; unless `dest` is **nil**, in which case no
    send is performed. `sendtag` is a non-negative integer that identifies
    the sent message. A block of `count` elements with datatype `datatype`
    is received from the process with rank `source` and stored in `buf`;
    unless `source` is **nil**, in which case no receive is performed.


Collective communication
------------------------

`mpi.barrier(comm)`

  : Blocks the calling process until all processes have called the function.

`mpi.bcast(buf, count, datatype, root, comm)`

  : Performs a broadcast operation. For each rank *i* in the communicator
    `comm`, the process with rank `root` sends a block of `count` elements

    `comm`, the process with rank *i* sends a block of `sendcount` elements
    with datatype `sendtype` in `sendbuf` to the process with rank `root`,
    which stores the values in the *i*-th block of `recvcount` elements

Process topologies
------------------

`mpi.cart_create(comm, dims, periods, reorder)`

  : Returns a new communicator that maps the processes in `comm` to a
    Cartesian grid. `dims` is a sequence that specifies the number of
    processes for each dimension of the grid. `periods` is a sequence that
    specifies for each dimension whether the grid is periodic (**true**) or
    non-periodic (**false**) along that dimension. If `reorder` is
    **true**, the ranks of the processes in the new communicator may be
    reordered to optimally map the Cartesian topology onto the machine
    topology; if `reorder` is **false**, the ranks of the processes remain
    the same as in `comm`.

    If the size of the Cartesian grid is smaller than the number of
    processes in `comm`, the function returns **nil** on some processes.

`mpi.cart_get(comm)`

  : Returns three sequences that specify for each dimension of the
    Cartesian grid the number of processes, whether the grid is periodic
    (**true**) or non-periodic (**false**) along that dimension, and the
    coordinate of the calling process along that dimension.

`mpi.cart_coords(comm, rank)`

  : Returns a sequence with the Cartesian coordinates of the process with
    the given rank.

`mpi.cart_rank(comm, coords)`

  : Returns the rank of the process with the given Cartesian coordinates.

`mpi.cart_shift(comm, direction, disp)`

  : Returns the ranks of the source and destination processes in a
    Cartesian shift, which involves a send to the destination process
    in the given direction and a receive from the source process in the
    opposite direction. `direction` specifies the coordinate dimension
    along which the shift is performed. `disp` specifies the displacement
    of the destination process relative to the calling process, either
    a positive integer for an upwards shift or a negative integer for a
    downwards shift.

    If the shift to the calling process would cross a non-periodic boundary,
    the function returns **nil** inplace of a source rank; if the shift from
    the calling process would cross a non-periodic boundary, the function
    returns **nil** inplace of a destination rank.

`mpi.get_version()`

  : Returns the major and minor number of the MPI version.
